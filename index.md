# Color_pix2pix

This porject is based on pix2pix. The original pix2pix doesn't have the ability to choose the color. So I made a little reform 
in the original pix2pix network. In color_pix2pix, the network is breaked into 2 parts. The first part generates the gray images according to the edges pictures. The second part is aimed at coloring the gray pictures according to a rough color distribution.
